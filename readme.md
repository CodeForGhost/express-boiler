This is a Node.js boilerplate project built with:

1. **Express.js** as the web framework
2. **TypeScript** for type-safe development
3. **Prisma** as the ORM for database operations
4. **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern

Here's a detailed breakdown of the setup:

### Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains the main source code
- `prisma/` - Contains database schema and migrations
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated after build)
- `.example.env` - Environment variables template
- Configuration files: `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`

### Dependencies

The project includes several important packages:

- **Core**: Express.js, TypeScript, Prisma
- **Security**: bcrypt (password hashing), helmet (security headers), jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication)
- **Utilities**: cors, dotenv, morgan (logging), express-validator

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server with hot-reload
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run start      # Run the compiled application
npm run prisma:generate  # Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:push      # Push database schema changes
npm run prisma:studio    # Open Prisma Studio for database management
```

### TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` is configured with:

- ES2018 target
- CommonJS modules
- Strict type checking
- Source files in `src/` directory
- Output in `dist/` directory

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.example.env` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
4. Generate Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   ```
5. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The project follows best practices with:

- Type safety through TypeScript
- Modern ES2018+ features
- Security middleware (helmet, cors)
- Database abstraction with Prisma
- Development tools for hot-reloading
- Environment variable management
- Proper project structure following MVC pattern

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the setup in more detail?
